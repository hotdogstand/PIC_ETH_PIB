# PIC_ETH_PIB
PIC16 8-bit remote "Peripheral Interface Board" to allow a desktop or laptop to interact with hardware via an ethernet connection. The goal is to build a project that allows a desktop application to manipulate hardware via ethernet.

Design Objectives:
3.3-12V (or higher)-tolerant digital inputs and outputs
Analog-to-Digital Converters
Digital-to-Analog Converters
PWM Outputs via H-bridge (adjustable duty cycle and frequency)
Frequency Counter


Thoughts:
Expose SPI interface, I2C interface for testing sensors, etc?
